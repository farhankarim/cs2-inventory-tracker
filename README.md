## Usage

### Steam Market History Tracker

The market history tracker requires Steam authentication cookies to access your private transaction history.

#### Step 1: Extract Cookies

Install the **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** Chrome extension:
[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?pli=1)

1. **Install the extension** from the Chrome Web Store
2. **Log into Steam** in your browser and navigate to Steam Market
3. **Click the extension icon** in your browser toolbar
4. **Select "steamcommunity.com"** from the dropdown
5. **Save the cookies** to a file named `cookie.txt` in your project directory

#### Step 2: Run Market History Analysis

```bash
# Using cookie file (recommended)
python inventory.py --cookie-file cookie.txt

# Output to custom file
python inventory.py --cookie-file cookie.txt --output my_trades.csv

# Limit to first 5 pages for testing
python inventory.py --cookie-file cookie.txt --max-pages 5

# Get raw JSON data instead of CSV
python inventory.py --cookie-file cookie.txt --json > raw_data.json
```

#### Market History Features

- **Profit/Loss Calculation**: Automatically pairs bought and sold items using FIFO (First In, First Out)
- **Sticker Cost Tracking**: Identifies when you applied purchased stickers to items and adjusts profit calculations
- **Transaction Types**:
  - `Bought & Sold`: Complete transactions with profit/loss calculation
  - `Bought (Not Sold)`: Items you bought but haven't sold yet
  - `Sold (Not Bought)`: Items you sold but didn't originally purchase (e.g., drops, gifts)
  - `Sticker Bought/Sold`: Separate tracking for sticker transactions

#### Example Output

```

### Inventory Tracker (Original)

#### Basic Usage (Default Profile)

Run the script with the default profile URL:
```bash
python fetch_inventory.py
```

This will fetch inventory from: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/farhankarim/inventory`

#### Custom Profile URL

You can specify a different Steam profile URL as a command-line argument:
```bash
python fetch_inventory.py https://steamcommunity.com/id/your-steam-id/inventory
```

Or with a 64-bit Steam ID:
```bash
python fetch_inventory.py https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198XXXXXXXXX/inventory
```

### Output

The script will:
1. Display all inventory items in the console, grouped by type
2. Show tradable and marketable status for each item
3. Save the complete inventory data to `inventory.json`

Example output:
```
================================================================================
CS2 INVENTORY - Total Items: 45
================================================================================

Base Grade Container (5 items):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  â€¢ CS:GO Weapon Case
    Tradable: âœ“ | Marketable: âœ“

  â€¢ Chroma 3 Case
    Tradable: âœ“ | Marketable: âœ“
...
```

### JSON Output

The `inventory.json` file contains detailed information about each item:
```json
[
  {
    "asset_id": "123456789",
    "class_id": "987654321",
    "instance_id": "0",
    "amount": "1",
    "name": "AK-47 | Redline",
    "market_name": "AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)",
    "market_hash_name": "AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)",
    "type": "Rifle",
    "tradable": 1,
    "marketable": 1,
    "commodity": 0,
    "icon_url": "...",
    "name_color": "D2D2D2",
    "background_color": "",
    "tags": [...]
  }
]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Market History Options

```bash
# Custom delay between requests (default: 0.8 seconds)
python inventory.py --cookie-file cookie.txt --delay 1.5

# Using manual cookie string instead of file
python inventory.py --cookie "sessionid=abc123; steamLoginSecure=xyz789"

# Using environment variable
export STEAM_COOKIE="sessionid=abc123; steamLoginSecure=xyz789"
python inventory.py
```

### CSV Output Format

The market history CSV includes these columns:
- `name`: Item name
- `bought_price`: Purchase price (if applicable)
- `sold_price`: Sale price (if applicable)  
- `profit_loss`: Calculated profit/loss including sticker costs
- `transaction_type`: Type of transaction
- `stickers`: List of attached stickers
- `sticker_costs`: Individual sticker purchase costs

## Security Notes

### Cookie Safety
- **Never share your cookie file** - it contains sensitive authentication data
- **Add `cookie.txt` to `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits
- **Regenerate cookies periodically** by logging out and back into Steam
- **Use the browser extension method** rather than manual cookie extraction

### Rate Limiting
- The script includes automatic delays between requests
- Don't run multiple instances simultaneously
- Respect Steam's servers and terms of service

## Troubleshooting

### Market History Issues

**"Authentication failed" or receiving HTML instead of JSON:**
- Ensure your cookies are fresh (re-extract them)
- Make sure you're logged into Steam in the same browser
- Verify the cookie file format is correct

**"Debug: Using cookies: []":**
- Check that your cookie file is in the correct Netscape format
- Ensure the file path is correct
- Try re-extracting cookies with the browser extension

### Inventory Tracker Issues

**"Inventory is private":**
- Set your Steam inventory to public in Privacy Settings

**"Could not extract Steam ID":**
- Ensure the profile URL format is correct
- Profile should be accessible and public
